# Basic-React-Calculator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Task

For this assessment, you will be building a calculator in React. You are provided with code snippets, and your task is to use these, plus any of your code to complete a calculator app that can perform the four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Steps

fork this repo to your github account
download the codes
run `npm install` in the project's directory
run `npm start` to review the calculator

## Before you begin

Inside the terminal, you need to open the folder that contains the package.json file. This is because you need to install the node_modules folder using the `npm install` command, with your terminal pointing to the folder that contains the package.json file. You should be familiar with these steps because they are the same ones you've had to take while working on the ungraded labs in the course's live code labs.

Once the npm install command is finished, you can serve the app locally by running the `npm start` command, with your terminal still pointing at the folder containing your peer's app files.
